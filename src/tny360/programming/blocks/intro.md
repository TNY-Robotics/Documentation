# Programming your TNY - 360 with Blocks

This section will guide you through the process of programming your TNY - 360 with Blocks.


## Prerequisites

Before you start programming your TNY - 360 with Blocks, you need to have the following prerequisites:

- A TNY - 360
- A computer with a web browser and an internet connection


## Getting started

To get started, you need to open the [TNY - 360 Blocks Editor](https://tny360.projects.furwaz.com/blocks). This is a web-based tool that allows you to program your TNY - 360 using a block-based interface.

### Toolbox

The Blocks Editor provides you with a toolbox that contains different categories of blocks. You can drag and drop these blocks into the workspace to create your program.

### Workspace

The workspace is where you can arrange the blocks to create your program. You can connect the blocks together to define the flow of your program.

### The `Setup` and `Loop` blocks

There are two special blocks in the workspace:

- The `Setup` block is where you can define the setup code that will run once when the program starts.
- The `Loop` block is where you can define the main code that will run repeatedly in a loop.

### Running, stopping, and stepping through the program

At the bottom right corner of the Blocks Editor, you will find 3 buttons:

- The **Play** button in yellow allows you to run the program.
- The **Step** button in blue allows you to step through the program one block at a time.
- The **Stop** button in red allows you to stop the program.

Now that you know how to use the Block Editor, you can start programming your TNY - 360.
But first, you need to connect to your robot.
